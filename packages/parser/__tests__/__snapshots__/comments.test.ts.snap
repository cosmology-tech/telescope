Service implementors can use the following guidelines to decide
between \`FAILED_PRECONDITION\`, \`ABORTED\`, and \`UNAVAILABLE\`:
(a) Use \`UNAVAILABLE\` if the client can retry just the failing call.
(b) Use \`ABORTED\` if the client should retry at a higher level
(e.g., when a client-specified test-and-set fails, indicating the
client should restart a read-modify-write sequence).
(c) Use \`FAILED_PRECONDITION\` if the client should not retry until
the system state has been explicitly fixed.  E.g., if an \\"rmdir\\"
fails because the directory is non-empty, \`FAILED_PRECONDITION\`
should be returned since the client should not retry unless
the files are deleted from the directory.

Unlike \`INVALID_ARGUMENT\`, this error indicates a problem that may
be fixed if the system state changes. For example, a 32-bit file
system will generate \`INVALID_ARGUMENT\` if asked to read at an
offset that is not in the range [0,2^32-1], but it will generate
\`OUT_OF_RANGE\` if asked to read from an offset past the current
file size.

There is a fair bit of overlap between \`FAILED_PRECONDITION\` and
\`OUT_OF_RANGE\`.  We recommend using \`OUT_OF_RANGE\` (the more specific
error) when it applies so that callers who are iterating through

they are done.
