# Packages and workspace

We use lerna/yarn workspaces. You'll see we have in our `./packages` folder numerous packages:

```
├── ast
├── babel
├── lcd
├── parser
├── telescope
├── test
├── types
└── utils
```

| folder    | purpose                                                                        |
| --------- | -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |
| ast       | for creating new AST functions                                                 |
| lcd       | for giving LCD clients to generated code that uses the LCD client              |
| parser    | protobuf parser, and protobuf traversal                                        |
| telescope | the CLI, as well as the main `telescope` builder                               |
| starship      | using starship for testing things locally or in CI workflow                                                     |
| types     | types and `TelescopeOptions` objects                                           |

### Editing interdependent packages

Because we are using lerna/yarn workspaces, packages in the `./packages` folder act as local `npm` modules.

If you edit a package, make sure to cd into it, and run `yarn buidl`, or separately, `yarn build` and `yarn build:ts`.

For example, if you edit a file in `./packages/types` and you want to make sure it's up-to-date in another package, such as `./packages/ast`, the changes propagate after you run these commands:

```
yarn build
yarn build:ts # now the types will also show up
```
